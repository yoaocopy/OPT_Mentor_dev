# OPM (Offline Python Mentor)

OPM is a serverless implementation of Online Python Tutor Lite (OPTLite) designed for offline use and enhanced educational environments. This project builds upon the [optlite](https://github.com/dive4dec/optlite) concept while making it more accessible and secure for educational settings. Integrated with [WEBLLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm) for advanced language model capabilities.

## Features

- **Serverless Operation**: Runs entirely in the browser using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org)
- **Offline Capability**: Can be used without internet connection
- **Enhanced Security**: No server-side code execution, reducing security risks
- **Educational Focus**: Perfect for classroom settings and online exams
- **Safe Exam Browser Compatible**: Works with [Safe Exam Browser](https://safeexambrowser.org/)
- **Interactive Visualization**: Visual representation of Python program execution
- **Live Editing Mode**: Real-time code editing and visualization

## Installation (for local host)
1. Ensure you have Docker installed on your system
2. Run the command in cmd or terminal
   ```docker-compose up -d --build```
3. The script will:
   - Build the Docker image of optlite-webllm and AI-model
   - RUN the docker container


## Project Structure

```

## Development
The project consists of several key components:
- **OPT Lite**: The core visualization engine
- **JupyterLite Integration**: For notebook-based interactions
- **WebLLM Integration**: For serverless AI assistant
- **Pyodide Runtime**: For in-browser Python execution
- **[optmwidgets](https://github.com/chiwangso2/optmwidgets)**: A widget built on top of [divewidgets](https://github.com/dive4dec/divewidgets) that provide programming ai assistant using webllm and langchain.

## Requirements
- Docker

## Acknowledgments

- Based on [optlite](https://github.com/dive4dec/optlite)
